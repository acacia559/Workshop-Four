# Workshop-Four
Fifth Workshop task for Fine Arts 205 
For this workshop I wanted to fork another students code and work on it so I made a fork of Clementine's workshop 4 task , her github -> https://github.com/clementine0507 .
Before I got started on editing her code, I played around with my own images, following the workshop video.

at first nothing came up when I input the code and then I realised 'emojis' was the name of leo's folder so then I changed the code so that the name was 'Images' as this is what I had labeled my own folder.

This still didn't work and then I remembered that in the previous workshop, I had to resize my images for them to show up in the canvas.

This finally worked and so I went on to use the mousePressed function.

once I had completed this I decided to work from the fork I made of Clementine's workshop 4 task.

when I first opened the fork in VScodium it didn't work for me so I made some edits to the code but it still didn't work.

after that I decided to hide some of the code and work on the button functions to start with. This still didn't work and then I relised I was missing the libraries file so I added that and then I was able to work on the code.

I then just continued to experiment before finalising.
